# dataviz_baseball
Source files used in my Thinkful data visualization workshop.

__TO-DO:__
1. Do a runthrough of a simple bar graph in `matplotlib` using letter frequency.
2. Demonstrate how to present via `ipython nbconvert` and make slideshows.
    * show how to hide your code with a little custom CSS.
3. Load the day-to-day standings into iPython from CSV.
    * show how to grab the file, just a simple walkthrough.
