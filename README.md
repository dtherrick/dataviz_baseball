# dataviz_baseball
Source files used in my Thinkful data visualization workshop.

__Overview__

This repo serves as the basis for the interactive dat visualization workshop I host via Thinkful.

__Map__

1. `./iPython`:
    * these are the interactive notebooks that show various visializations, interactive settings of the notebook, and how to use third party APIs.
2. `modules`:
    * this folder contains a simple class I use to grab statistics from [baseball-reference.com](http://baseball-reference.com)
    * I also added a tests example to show how to run a simple test suite.
